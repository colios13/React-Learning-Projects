# React projects

A list of project I have made following this [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8&t=352s) to practice React.

1. The first project is React info site, it's just a simple static one page project using CDN. (I used [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) webserver to render it)
