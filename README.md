# React projects

A list of project I have made following this [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8&t=352s) to practice React.

1. The first project is react-info-site, it's just a simple static single page using CDN displaying some fact on React. (I used [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) webserver to render it)
2. The second project is a remake of the first project but using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) and a better design.
3. The third project is a solo project, the goal was to build a business digital card on my own.
